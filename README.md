# AppStoreReviews

- This application fetches and displays App Store reviews. 
- It is built using Xcode 15.0.1 and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern for a clean and maintainable codebase. 
- A separate Swift Package Manager (SPM) package handles networking, ensuring modularity and reusability. 
- The code is highly testable, with unit tests covering all use cases.
- Routers are used to make routing operations, well seperated from UI classes
